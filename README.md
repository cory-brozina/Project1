This is a README for Project 1 in Getting and Cleaning Data


#Loading the test set first: x and y, features and subjects


# Combine the features to the X_test so that X_test has correct column labels

# Change the column label for subject_test and y_test and combine it with the X_test data

#Loading the train set files now: x,y, and subject


# Combine the features to the X_train so that X_train has correct column labels


# Change the column label for subject_train and y_train and combine it with the X_train data


#Now we can combine the test set and the train set into one data set


#Reducing X_test data set down to just the means/std reported


#Now let's name all the Activity labels for that column instead of having numbers


#Obtaining averages across variables by Subject and Activity


#Saving the new data set, aggdata, to a text file on your computer
